# Arachnid

## Setting Up

In the `interface` directory:
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to start local server

## Key Files

- `src/components/DataPane.js` is where vega loads the visualization and handles all the interactions
- `src/examples/cars.json` - for now just change the data in this file and then change the corresponding parts of the specification to select the appropriate variable names
